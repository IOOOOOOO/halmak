# Halmak Keyboard Layout

This is an AI designed keyboard layout that was built within the
[keyboard-gentics](https://github.com/MadRabbit/keyboard-genetics) project.
More details and a documented process can be found in
[this blog](http://nikolay.rocks/categories/optimal+keyboard)

## Features

* Build based on the real world hand movements analysis
* Nearly maximal possible typing efficiency
* Very low overall fingers movement distance
* Very low same finger / same hand usage overheads
* Very low overall horizontal hands movement
* Highly symmetrical design that accounts for individual fingers strength
* Designed with the modern, web based English in mind

## Comparisons

During the research I've identified the following results: in terms of efficiency

* `QWERTY` - `0%` (base line)
* `Dvorak` - `+77%`
* `Colemak` - `+84%`
* `Workman` - `+101%`
* `Halmak` - `+134%`

Please refer to [this article](http://nikolay.rocks/2016-12-20-the-halmak-reborn)
for the more detailed breakdown of the results.

All scripts are opensourced and can be verified in the
[keyboard-gentics](https://github.com/MadRabbit/keyboard-genetics) repository.

## The Name

The name is a combination of `HAL-9000`, as a reference to the layout being
designed by an AI. And, `Dvorak` as a gratitude to Mr. Dvorak for his dedication
to the layouts optimizations process. The letter `m` in between is just to make
it sound nicer. Or is it!?...

## Installation

* Git clone all the stuff somewhere
* Copy `Halmak.bundle` into your `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder (create if it is missing)
* Sign out, Sign in
* Go to the keyboard preferences and add the `Halmak` layout
* Ask here in issues if nothing works

## Learning

There is an unofficial support module for the [TypeFu app](http://type-fu.com)
that provides support for the `Halmak` layout:

Again, I'm not sure if there is a point to this. But I guess it's MIT.
